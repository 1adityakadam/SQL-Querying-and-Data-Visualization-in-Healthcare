I have created three datasets using MySQL and exported them into CSV files for further visualization. 
The tables, named 'doctors_homework1', 'hospital_homework1', and 'specialities', and the SQL file, named 'hospitals doctors and specialities' are uploaded to the repository for reference.

Additionally, I have conducted querying and data visualization for the following five queries:

Q1: Which licenses are held by doctors who are accepting new patients?
Q2: What is the count of doctors with insurance at each hospital?
Q3: What is the percentage of male and female doctors at every hospital?
Q4: What is the number of doctors per city who specialize in hypertension?
Q5: What is the percentage of doctors per specialty?
